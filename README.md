# 🧮 Interactive Calculator in Ruby

## 📋 Description

This project was developed as part of the **Final Challenge of Module I in the Ruby Track at DIO**.
The goal is to create a **simple interactive calculator** with a menu that allows the user to select a mathematical operation and view the result directly in the terminal.

🔹 **Available operations:**  
1️⃣ Addition
2️⃣ Subtraction
3️⃣ Multiplication
4️⃣ Division
0️⃣ Exit

This project is a great introduction to **conditionals, loops, user input, and Ruby best practices**.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Ruby** → Main programming language (version 2.5+ recommended).

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyraleo23/dio-ruby-calculadora.git
cd dio-ruby-calculadora
```

### Step 2: Run the Script
```bash
ruby calculadora.rb
```

### Step 3: Use the Calculator
📌 Follow the instructions in the terminal to choose an operation and enter the numbers.

### 📂 Project Structure  
```markdown
📂 dio-ruby-calculadora  
 ├── calculadora.rb       # Main script with calculator logic  
 └── README.md            # Project documentation  
```

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- **Conditionals** → Handle menu options
- **Loops** → Allow multiple operations until the user chooses to exit
- **Input and Output** → Interaction via `gets.chomp` and `puts`
- **Basic Math Operations** → Implementation of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
